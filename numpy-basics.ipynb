    "## 1.2. Installing Numpy and setting up the development environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with `Numpy`, we first need to install the library and set up our development environment. Follow the steps below to install `Numpy` and set up a Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your command prompt or terminal (e.g., Press Command + Space Bar on your Mac keyboard and Type in â€œTerminal\").\n",
    "2. If you have Python installed, you can install `Numpy` by running the following command:\n",
    "`pip install numpy`. This command will download and install `Numpy` from the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Set up Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an interactive coding environment that allows you to create and share documents containing code, visualizations, and explanatory text. Here's how to set it up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal: `pip install jupyter`\n",
    "2. Launch Jupyter Notebook by typing the following command and pressing Enter: `jupyter notebook`. This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.\n",
    "3. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, click on \"New\" and select \"Python 3\" to create a new Python notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Importing Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Jupyter notebook, you need to import the `Numpy` library before using its functions and features. To import Numpy, add the following line of code at the beginning of your notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "`import numpy as np`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** By convention, `Numpy` is often imported with the alias `np`, which allows us to use the shorthand notation `np` when referring to `Numpy` functions throughout our notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! You have successfully installed `Numpy` and set up your Jupyter notebook environment. Now, you're ready to dive into the basics of `Numpy` and explore its powerful capabilities for machine learning."
